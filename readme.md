# Pinterest like Image-Board - "Thai-Streetfood-Love"

"Thai-Streetfood-Love" was my second project built within 5 days at SPICED Academy.

The SPA is built with Vue.js, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL and the AWS-Sdk and is
a Pinterest like Image-Board, where Users can Upload and share Pictures.
Users must add a Username, Title and Description before uploading it to the Amazon Web Services.

After Uploading the Image Section refreshes automatically and Users can Comment on each Picture.
